    <h2>60th Anniversary Celebration</h2>

    <article class="">
      <p>Naledi High Heritage School was founded on 8th June, 1963. On the 8th June, 2023, the school will be celebrating its 60th anniversary since being founded. </p>


      <p>Throughout its 60 years of existence, Naledi High School, as an educational institution, has contributed significantly towards the culture and heritage of Johannesburg, as well as South Africa, as a whole. The school was founded after the passing of the Unlawful Organizations Act, 1960, which banned the traditional political organisations that used to champion the socio-political and socio-economic discourse of African natives during the Apartheid dispensation of governance; namely, the African National Congress (ANC) and Pan-African Congress (PAC).</p>

      <p>The political consciousness vacuum created by the banning of traditional African native political movements with the passing of the Unlawful Organizations Act, 1960, encouraged African natives who may have been apolitical, to conjure up creative ways to champion their socio-political and socio-economic interests.  The Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) emerged around 1968, founded by African native student activists such as Steve Biko, among others. The BCM was aimed at encouraging African natives to take pride in their ethnicity and heritage, and introduce practical ways in which they could build self-reliant, thriving communities.</p>

      <p>The activities of the BCM would, in many ways, go on to inspire a new wave of political consciousness and activism that neither the ANC nor the PAC could inspire, prior to their banning. Unlike the traditional political organisations, the BCM introduced community-development projects and/or programmes that championed socioeconomic self-reliance and having pride in the African heritage and culture.</p>

      <p>The activities of the BCM would soon reach the shores of Soweto and, more specifically, Naledi High Heritage School. Exposure to the politics of the BCM encouraged students, and some of their teachers, to form political consciousness movements and organisations. A wide variety of issues formed part of student politics, at that time. Some of the main issues included exposure to legislated low-quality education (Bantu Education), and the students’ inability to fully economically develop, as a result of the exposure to the low-quality of education forced on African native students, among other things.</p>

      <p>Around April, in 1976, when Mr Enos Ngutshane, then student at Naledi High School, wrote and sent a letter to then Minister of Bantu Education, Mr Michiel Botha, informing him that students reject the implementation of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction and learning, it happened against the backdrop of a myriad of student issues identified and championed through various student movements. On the 8th of June, 1976, (the 13th anniversary of the school’s founding), the Apartheid Police sent two officers to arrest Mr Ngutshane on the school’s premises, which resulted in the rest of the students revolting against the officers.</p>

      <p>The June 8th, 1976 student rebellion at Naledi High School, which resulted in the stoning and burning of the VolksWagen (VW) Beetle the officers were travelling in and some injuries to those officers, became an important precursor to what the world would come to know as the Soweto Uprising that took place on the 16th June, 1976. On the 16th June, 1976, student activists implemented what they thought would be a peaceful protest to Orlando Stadium, against the low-quality education that was forced upon them, as well as the medium of instruction used to deliver that low-quality educational content, among other student issues.</p>

      <p>The Soweto Uprising, on the 16th June, 1976, was scheduled to begin at Naledi High School, and march to Orlando Stadium while collecting students from other high schools in Soweto. The Apartheid security forces responded to the march by sending armed police forces to Naledi, to intimidate students at their point of departure, at Naledi High School. It is seldom reported, however, the first casualty of the Soweto Uprising was in Naledi, a few meters from the Naledi High School premises. Despite the shooting, students decided to continue with the protest, to which the police responded by calling for more backup.</p>

      <p>By the time the Soweto Uprising protest had reached Orlando, and grown in size, near the planned point of gathering, at the Orlando Stadium, students realised the police backup had arrived, armed. Since the Soweto Uprising was a peaceful protest, the students were not armed. When the police ordered the students to abandon the protest or face being shot at and arrested, many responded by seeking objects they could use to protect themselves from the bullets, and attempted to continue with the protest. For self-defence, the students used stones, and rubbish-bin lids.</p>

      <p>The police opened fire on the protesting students, as well as anyone that happened to be close to their protest.  While some students got shot, injured and murdered, some were arrested, and the leaders of the Soweto Uprising became some of the country’s most sought after persons. While the media circulated pictures and stories of the Soweto Uprising throughout the world, many of the students that took part in the protest had to go into exile, with some joining traditional political parties that had been banned in the 1960s, in exile.</p>

      <p>Once South Africa transitioned to the Government of National Unity (GNU) structure, in 1994, some of those students that had taken part in student politics around the 1970s returned home to take their places in government, some government institutions, as well as private sector leadership.</p>

      <p>Despite having some members of the Naledi High Heritage School go into government and various key leadership positions, after the 1994 transition, the story of Naledi High Heritage School has never been told in a manner that fully reflects the school’s contribution to the nation’s fight for independence.</p>

      <p>In the mainstream media, for instance, the purpose for the 16th June 1976 Soweto Uprising is often reduced to protesting against Afrikaans as a medium of instruction, and Naledi High Heritage School reduced to a footnote about the Soweto Uprising point of departure. In reality, Naledi High Heritage School played a far greater role in the country’s struggles for independence. Some of the politically-conscious teachers at Naledi High School that began introducing students to the politics of the BCM, which advocated for taking pride in African ethnicity and heritage, as well as African-centred socioeconomic projects to encourage self-reliance, not only drove political consciousness, but also, provided hide-outs for students who were wanted by the police.</p>

      <p>The Naledi High School premises provided physical space on-which some teachers and their students (including students from other schools such as Morris Issacson High School) could drive political consciousness. In turn, the students learning about political consciousness at Naledi High School (among other schools) used the school as a platform to drive peer-to-peer political consciousness initiatives among members of the youth, although they had to be cautious of who knew their plans and activities.</p>

      <p>It is of great importance that the contribution of Naledi High Heritage School, its alumni, and their politics be reported fully and accurately. Reducing the contribution of the school and its alumni’s politics to a mere point of departure of the Soweto Uprising protest, as well as reducing the Soweto Uprising, itself, to a protest against Afrikaans, gives the illusion that the politics of the Soweto Uprising were addressed and solved, with the transition to the GNU in 1994. This, however, is a fallacy.</p>

      <p>With the advent of the transition to the GNU, in 1994, Naledi High School, together with 7 other schools that played a significant role in the fight against Apartheid (including Morris Isaacson) in Soweto, was recognised as a heritage school. Contributions from the government, State Owned Entities (SOEs), and some private sector institutions were made to improve the physical conditions the school was in, at that time. A rugby/soccer field and athletic track were erected at the school, and a few renovations made to the physical infrastructure. In addition, memorial stones were erected on the school’s premises to commemorate some members of the alumni that played a role in the fight against Apartheid.</p>

      <p>Less than 15 years after the school was declared a heritage school and had minor refurbishments done, however, the school is in a deplorable state. Not only is the physical infrastructure mostly in a dilapidated state, but also, learners’ academic development is compromised. Given the conditions the school finds itself in, some members of the Naledi High School alumni from the 1970s would argue that their 1970s struggles have not been addressed, despite having Naledi High School declared as a heritage school.</p>

      <p>2023 marks 60 years since the founding of Naledi High School and, despite the conditions the school finds itself in, members of the school’s alumni, the school’s management, as well as some community stakeholders have decided to host a 60th Anniversary Celebratory event, aimed at bestowing the necessary honour to the school and its alumni for their contribution towards the country’s struggles for independence.</p>

      <p>In addition to honouring the school for its contribution in the struggles against Apartheid, the 60th Anniversary Celebration is also aimed at gathering the necessary resources needed to refurbish the school, and get it to a point where it can produce leaders who go on to influence the country positively, as was the case in the 1970s.</p>

      <p>As a heritage institution, Naledi High Heritage School also has an important part to play towards the socioeconomic development of Naledi, the township at-which it operates. The 60th Anniversary Celebration will also be used to facilitate better cohesion between the school and its community, to ensure that refurbishments are sustainable and serve the greater community.</p>
